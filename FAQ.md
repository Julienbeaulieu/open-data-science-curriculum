**Who is this this for?**

The following curriculum is intended for anyone who wants to learn data science in a self-taught way, irrespective of what their current background is. It therefore assumes no prior knowledge of data science or coding, and only basic knowledge of high school math.

Whether you are seeking a career change, or want to apply data science in your current role, the resources listed here will help you achieve this goal.

If you already have experience in the field, are looking to refine a specific skill, or are in search of high quality content, I encourage you to look at the different modules and hand-pick what you find relevant.

**Who is this __not__ for?**

This curriculum is not for people who are looking for a traditional education and want a diploma.
It assumes that you are already extremely eager to learn data science, are self-driven, and motivated. This requirement is important because a lot of the resources listed are self-paced. A high amount of discipline and will are therefore essential.

The resources are chosen to prepare you to be up and running for an industry role. If you’re interested in academia and R&D, enroll in a university degree instead.

**Why choose a self-taught education?**

- Take advantage of the abundance of high-quality resources available online. This curriculum includes many courses from top universities (MIT, Stanford, University of San Francisco), MOOCs (Massive open online course) and bootcamps with outstanding reviews (Deeplearning.ai, Fastai, Le Wagon), and content from world class creators in the form of blog posts, videos, and books.
- Focus on state-of-the-art techniques that you can apply in industry. There aren't many university courses or bootcamps that teach the latest techniques such as those found in [Fastai](https://fast.ai) or at Standford's CS224n Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and then teach you how to deploy them to production.
- Have the flexibility to learn from anywhere around the world, and continue pursuing your studies part time if you find a job during the process.
- Become proficient in continuous learning. Following this path will teach you how to be autonomous in how you acquire new skills and rigorous in how you choose new learning material. These resources will accompany you at work and help you tremendously as you progress throughout your career.
- Put yourself out there and to showcase your work to others. Since you won’t rely on a college degree as a signal to get hired, you’ll be incentivised to create, share, and communicate your best work so that people will know what you are worth. These are essential skills when working at a company.

**How long will the entire cirruculum take to complete?**

This really depends on your existing background and if it is pursued full time or part time. Completing the curriculum end-to-end can easily take a year and a half full time if you have no prior background in data science. That said, the programme goes much deeper than a bootcamp and will give you more hands-on experience than most master’s degrees.

**Won't I be disadvantaged during my job search when compared to people graduating in data science with a formal degree?**

Make no mistake, unless you really put the work in, choosing this path will put you at a disadvantage. Some hiring managers will instantly disqualify your candicacy because you don't have a college degree.
This path will require more effort, more dedication, and more self-discipline than if you were to enroll in a graduate data science degree. It is also, in my opinion, more enriching and fulfilling when you succeed. It will be up to you to prove that you are as skilled, if not moreso, than the others.

If you manage to make it through the curriculum (or a similar equivalent version of it), if you did so by engaging in different communities, by working with others, joining study groups and collaborating on project in a team, I believe you will be more qualified for an industry job than someone that is graduating from your average data science university program.
Create a blog to write about what you learned and the projects you worked on, open source all the code you wrote on a platform like Github. Communicate about the grit it took to take a self-taught route and succeeding in it. When you feel confident in your abilities, start networking and reaching out to different people. 
If all this is tru

**Who am I and why should you listen to me?**

In early 2019, I decided to quit my job in digital marketing and engage full time in learning data science to transition careers. All university programs I had looked at were first of all, not cheap, and second, due to start only 8 months after I was prepared to make the leap. However, I was not willing to wait that long to start learning so I enrolled in a few online courses. After several months, I realized the cheer amount of outstanding resources that were at my disposal and the potential there was to build myself an elite education if I hand picked the best content. I just needed to arrange and organize everything in a way that made sense for my learning goals and interests. 

Through trial and error, auditing and completing tons of courses, books, online content, and by looking at other poeple's curated resource lists, I have developped the Open Data Science Curriculum.


**What is the vision behind the Open Data Science Curriculum?**

The vision of this initiative is to help solve the problems discussed in the [The problems and challenges with learning data science in 2022](open_data_science_curriculum.md) section.
This curriculum is a very basic first step towards that goal.
Ideally, every individual would be assessed in order to understand what they already know, and what their objectives are. A personnalized curriculum would then be specifically tailored for them. People starting out in the field need coaching, advice, guidance, support, and someone to help them view the bigger picture in order to reach their objectives.

The vision is to create a community of learners and coaches to democratize data science for people who want to learn outside the traditional education route.

If you're interested in helping out, have ideas about how to solve this, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.
I have side projects that I plan to develop over the course of the next few months. Reach out if you would like learn more and if you want to help.
