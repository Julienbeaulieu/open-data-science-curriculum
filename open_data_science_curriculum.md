## Summary

The Open Data Science Curriculum is an opinionated curation of top resources, a justification as to why they were chosen, and a suggested path to become a data scientist. It is intended to be a **complete education in data science** using online materials and a holistic approach to learning. The curriculum contains resources covering all core aspects of data science. It also includes content on how to learn effectively, mentions of influencers to follow, conferences to attend, links to important books, blogposts and Youtube channels, and encourages one to learn &collaborate with a community of students by means of its own Discord channel or through joining other existing communities.

**The problems and challenges with learning data science in 2022 (outside of University)**

- There is an unfathomable amount of online resources & books from which to choose from. Where do you start your learning journey? What specific content should you look at? This decision should depend on the quality of the course/book you look at, but also on your current background, education and future goals.
- How do you know if the course/book you are about to engage in is of high quality? How do you choose between two or more seemlingly equivalent, highly rated courses?
- There is a lack of best in class, frequently updated, curated resources that organizes material found online into a long term learning plan that covers all aspects of data science.
- A lot of popular curriculums only suggest content from their own platforms. The truth is, the best content on each subject comes from a variety of different sources and comes in many different formats.
- Often times articles that curate resources suggest too many options from which to choose from. It often resembles a course dump, and it's up to the reader to "guess" which ones are the most relevant for them.
- Data science is a mix of math, programming, and domain knowledge. How do you know when enough math is enough, or how much software engineering knowledge is needed to get hired?
- Bootcamps inaccurately make the promise that their students will get hired right after graduating. It's not that bootcamps are bad, some are definitely worth the money. But this is only true for people with existing programming or mathematical backgrounds prior to enrolling. With that in mind, what steps should be taken prior and after taking a bootcamp?

The content presented here is an attempt and a first iteration to help people get a better grasp as to how to navigate these difficulties and to help them ask the right questions about their learning journey. A lot of these answers are different for everyone. They should be reflected upon, discussed, and they may evolve as you progress and learn more about the field.

I am proposing a path inspired by my personal journey and my constant search of the best material on a given topic. It is a great start, but I encourage everyone to do their own research and adapt it for yourself.

**Objectives of this curriculum**

- Transition into a technical career that will safeguard your future and land you a more fulfulling job.
- Refine your skills on a subject you want to develop using the best resources on the internet.

## Curriculum


### Data Science Intro & Learning How to Learn

The best way to get into data science is to first learn how to program and to gain some familiarity with computer science foundations. Also, since you are about to engage in a lifetime of learning new concepts and skills, viewing the resources related to becoming a better learner is highly recommended.

>Note: ❤️s represent material I particularly enjoyed and recommend.

**Topics covered**:
`Introduction to AI` ,
`Introduction to computer science and Python`,
`Learning how to learn`

**Overview**

- For those new to programming, start with Harvard’s CS50’s introduction to programming with Python. David Malan is one of the pioneers of online teaching and his content is always top notch. This class is given for the first time in 2022.
- For a real challenge, or for those already somewhat familiar with programming, look at CS50’s introduction to Computer Science from the same professor. The exercises are more involved and there is a focus on the C programming language instead of Python. That said, it covers more material and computer science concepts. If you're not taking this course, and you probably shouldn't be if you're a total beginner, at least watch [lecture 0 - Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoXxevp1WRQ) for its marvelous introduction to computer science in general.
- Since you're about to start an epic learning journey, make sure you know how to apply the best techniques to efficient learning. Taking “Learning how to learn” on Coursera will yield immense benefits long term and give you a competitive advantage over your peers. The book on which the course is based on, “A Mind for Numbers”, and the brilliant “Pragmatic Thinking and Learning” are good complementary options too. For a quick summary of all three resources, refer to [this blogpost](https://julienbeaulieu.github.io/2020/05/25/lesser-known-facts-about-learning-how-to-get-better-at-studying/) or listen to [this podcast by Dr Paul Pen](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/misjudgements-myths-in-learning-with-special-guest-dr/id1523840607?i=1000520771175) for an excellent overview of the subject.
- Start your data science journey with Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. This is a great place to start to learn about statistics, probability, data wrangling, data visualization, etc.


### Core Data Science

If you can afford a bootcamp, I recommend taking what I consider is the best data science one out there: [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time)**. There is a heavy emphasis on practical exercises, the curriculum is constantly evolving with the latest libraries and technologies, and the final project involves deploying your own machine learning model. This intensive bootcamp, also available part time, will give you the big picture of what data science encompases end to end: math theory, data wrangling, data visualization, programming inside an IDE, Git, machine learning, deep learning, and data engineering.

If you’re not willing to spend too much money, you’re still in luck. Andrew Ng’s [machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), which was originally created in 2012 and has been taken by millions, just got updated! This is a unique opportunity to get quality education for cheap. Take this course as well as Udacity’s data Analyst Nanodegree, and you’re guaranteed to start off with solid foundations.

Next, check out Fastai's Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders. **I recommend only watching the first 6 lectures which focus on tree-based models**. The rest of the videos are on deep learning which is better covered in their more recent course listed below. Although this content is almost 5 years old, don’t let that discourage you from watching it: it is taught by one of the most respected data scientists in the world - [Jeremy Howard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/howardjeremy/?originalSubdomain=au) - and is full of gems. Case in point: I have impressed many colleagues even today with techniques taken directly from this course.

Pair the above with Andriy Burkov’s famous and succint The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book, as well as Wes McKinney’s Python for Data Analysis. One is more focused on ML theory, while the other is hands-on with Python. They are complementary and will solidify your understanding of all concepts covered so far. As a testament to the quality of the people I am referencing, [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/) is the creator of the widely-used open-source **pandas** package.

**Topics covered**:
`Data wrangling`
`Data collection with an API`,
`SQL`,
`Statistical tests & experiments`,
`Data visualization`,
`Machine Learning`,
`Deep Learning`,
`Random Forests`,
`Model interpretation techniques`

- Get a practical approach to machine learning with tree-based models and model interpretation with Fastai.
- Complement your learning with the very well written and concise Hundred Page Machine Learning Book.
- Python for data analysis book just got updated to its 3rd edition and is now fully available online. It is a practical, modern introduction for manipulating, processing, cleaning, and visualizing datasets in Python. It is a great way to get better at pandas, Numpy, and matplotlib which are fundamental to any data scientist.

### Core Programming

The following resources will help you become a good programmer, understand some core software engineering principles, and give you the tools to pass the technical tests that most employers send you during recruitment. I suggest reviewing this material early in your education because being a good programmer will pay off very fast.
You don’t need to go through all of this material in a linear way. Review this on an as-need basis but make sure you’re regularly coming back to it.

**Overview**

- If you're struggling with any programming concept in Python, make sure you search for videos of Corey Schafer explaining the subject. His videos are always well-built, clear and enlightening.
- This book is a practical, modern introduction for manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching datasets in Python. It is ideal for beginners and is a great way to get better at pandas, Numpy, and IPython.
- Familiarize yourself with common data structures and algorithms in Python with with Udacitys course which features practice exercises.
- Complete HackerRank exercises to refine your Python skills with interview-style questions.
- Once you’re comfortable with the basics of Python - that is to say, after at least 1 year of coding experience - you can slowly start reading Fluent Python for a deep dive on Python core language features and libraries. Note 1: Some of the later chapters are very advanced and optional. Note 2: Keep an eye out for the updated edition of the book which is coming soon.
- If you still aren't comfortable with the shell, version control (Git) and debugging, watch the lectures from MIT's Missing Semester and do the exercises. Seriously, don't neglect the exercises!

### Core Math

Machine learning is a mix of Statistics, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus. Some say that it’s not strictly necessary to go deep into mathematical theory and that it’s better to focus on coding. While there is some truth to this, if your end goal is to read, write, implement papers, and to be a true expert in data science, then do not neglect math.
The following list of resources will help you both get started if you’re a beginner, or let you go deep down the math rabbit whole if you’re advanced. Remember to practice solving exercises if you want what you're learning to stick.

**Topics covered**:
`Linear algebra`
`statistics`
`Vector calculus`
`Probability`
`and more`

**Overview**

- Get a great intuition for linear algebra with this fantastic resource: Essence of Linear Algebra by 3Blue1Brown.
- Learn all things statistics and machine learning with Statquest. Josh Starmer has a gift for breaking down complex ideas into some of the simplest and best explanations on the Web. He also recently [published a book which I encourage you to check out](https://www.amazon.com/StatQuest-Illustrated-Guide-Machine-Learning/dp/B09ZCKR4H6).
- Delve deep into linear algebra with prof. Gilbert Strang's amazing lecture which has been viewed by millions before. Complement with exercises in [his book](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/) (which includes solutions to the exercises). For a less in depth alternative, refer to Khan Academy.
- Learn the math required for machine learning with Marc Peter (and co.)'s book (advanced). Choose this option if you're a warrior, and are interested in fundamental research. 
- Don't forget to actually do the exercises and work on assigments. This is the only way you'll become good at math.  

### Deep Learning

After completing the courses in Core Data Science, and with more solid foundations in programming and machine learning theory, you can move onto deep learning if that’s an area that interests you. It can be tempting to jump straight to this section when you're starting because there are really cool applications to work on. My POV on this is if this is what really motivates you, try it out and see what you can get out of it. Remember to come back to the sections above however, or you will have gaping holes in your fundamentals which will come back and hunt you down the line.

**Topics covered**:
`Loss functions and optimization`, 
`Convolutional neural networks`,
`Recurrent neural networks`,
`Deep learning hardware and software`,
`Deep learning for tabular data`,
`NLP`,
`Computer vision`,
`Generative models`,

[Jay Alammar's blog](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | Jay Alammar | Blogposts

**Overview**

- Learn how to create state of the art models using the Fastai Library with Part 1 of their course. I suggest taking both the Fastai and Deep Learning Specialization courses together since one is more focused on coding while the other is more focused on the theory and math behind it. While you're at it, follow Fastai's course with their book.
- Both Chirs Maning's and Justin Johnson's (he used to teach the very popular CS231n at Stanford) courses are world class and will give you deep insights into the worlds of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision. Be sure to do the assignments since they have you code algorithms from scratch and give you a solid foundations to progress further. Both have updated YouTube videos of their 2021 course.
- The transformer architecture is widely used these days. To get a solid grap of what they are, be sure to read some of Jay Alammar's blogpost on the subject. 


### Data Engineering & MLOps

Working on machine learning for a company is usually a lot more involved than just running models inside a Jupyter notebook. The resources below will get you familiarized with the whole life-cyle of a machine learning system. You'll learn about formulating a problem, ingesting, labeling & cleaning data, building reusable pipelines for each step, deploying a model online and monitoring it, and much more. You'll gain preliminary notions about what it takes to put a model in production. As the field is maturing, knowing about these steps isn't optional anymore for anyone doing machine learning unless you're only doing R&D.

[SQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/) | Mode Analytics | Coding environment exercises

- Learn to rebuild some Pytorch modules as well as part of the Fastai library from scratch with Part 2 of the course. This is also a great lecture in API design and software engineering. 
- If you wish to specialize in machine learning more so than deep learning, look no further than Andrew Ng's famous machine learning lecture at Stanford.  
- If SQL is important for your projects and current/future job, become an expert with this SQL tutorial.


### Extras

In addition to all of the above, I suggest doing the following:
- Subscribe to these newsletters to stay up to date with data science news: [Andriy Burkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/detail/recent-activity/posts/), [Deeplearning.ai's The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/), [DataScienceWeekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/) for a constant flow of curated blogpost to stay up to date in the field.
- Subscribe to [Yannic Kilcher's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/YannicKilcher/videos) for news related to the latest trends in the industry. He also explains and reviews newly published papers.
- Regularly explore [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) to see if there are meetups on topics you are interested in. I have no recommendations since this is location dependant, but since Covid, some meetup groups are now 100% online - you potentially have access to meetups across the entire world.
- Attend conferences. One I highly suggest going to is [Pycon](https://pycon.org/), even if that means spending a bit of money to attend and travelling to a host city. The value you'll get from it will be worth it in my experience. It is a way for you to be inspired by all that is happening in the world of Python, engineering, and machine learning. Otherwise, you can get an online only ticket for cheaper.
- Participate in a Kaggle competition. Find a competition you're interested in joining, make sure you enroll at the very beginning. Find teammates to work with, and start coding! Visit the code section of the competition to read other competitor's code. There are always people sharing interesting work.   
- Participate in Hackathons. Keep an eye out for these events happening in your city, or look on meetup.com to find them.
- Actively look for and join communities on Reddit, Discord, and Slack. For instance, subscribe to Reddit's /r/learnmarchinelearning and /r/machinelearning subreddits. Join discord servers to find study groups so that you're not learning alone.
- Put yourself out there and start writing! Create a personal blog and write articles about what you learned. Your target audience should be people in the same situation you were in 6 months / 1 year ago.
- Find a meetup group and ask if you can present a subject you've been working on. Do the same within a bunch of different study groups. This will help your oral presentation skills.
- Keep an eye out for recruiting events in your area. Companies are always participating in these events.
- Update your CV and LinkedIn profile to match your studies and personal projects.
